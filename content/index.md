Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nikhil.

In my day-job, I work as lighting engineer with expertise in lighting components and controls. All fields (even lighting) are converging towards Tech and I hope to contribute in the near future to bridge this gap.

While I try to enjoy my time in lighting, I also pursue a part-time MS degree through Georgia Tech's [OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu). My time in the program has gotten me deeply intrigued into mathematics, machine learning and all things Bayesian. In my free time, I try to update my *inductive priors* on these topics as much as possible. ðŸ™ƒ

# Backprogating? What?
In machine learning, [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) is a technique to update the weights of a neural network. In the same way, this site aims to be an archive of posts and notes that help you update the weights of your brain.
